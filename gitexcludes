# This becomes like a global .gitignore file for git repositories on your
# machine. Here, you can tell git about files you want it to ignore, without
# needing to make changes to .gitignore files in version control.

# You should only do this for files that are generated by your unique workflow
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# For files that others will always generate from build processes, for example,
# you should still use .gitignore files and keep them in version control, so
# that others always have access to the list of excluded patterns.
